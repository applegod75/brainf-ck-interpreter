# interpreter
This is an interpreter for the esotaric programming language: Brainfuck. As this is an interpreter, it might be a bit slow

# issues
1: This is an interpreter, so pretty slow. I'm going to make a compiler soon
2: as an input, you can only use numbers.
3: You need to add this path to use it properly, and you can only add the filename once you're executing the code
